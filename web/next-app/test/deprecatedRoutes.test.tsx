// /concept and /session are client redirect stubs with no internal caller: no nav entry, not in
// the indexable routes, no link in the app, and, until this file, no test. The only thing
// keeping them is external links and old bookmarks, which cannot be measured from here.
//
// So this test does not decide whether they stay. It pins what they currently do, so that
// deleting them is a deliberate, visible change rather than a quiet removal, and so that
// whoever makes the call knows exactly what breaks for an old link.
//
// `/study` is deliberately NOT in this file any more: ADR-054 restored it as a real,
// context-bound reference route, and its own tests live in `studyPage.test.tsx`. It still
// forwards to `/learn` when there is no `?concept=`, because there is nothing to show without one.
