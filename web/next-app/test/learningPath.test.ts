// Reference access and learning eligibility are different things, and this file pins the
// boundary between them.
//
// ADR-047 closed `/study` as a learner workflow because it was a *catalogue*: a browsable
// library of whole lessons with its own search and domain index, linked from the header, the tab
// bar, the sidebar and the footer, so a learner could read their way to a concept instead of
// being taught it. ADR-054 restored `/study` as a **context-bound reference page**, one concept
// named in the URL, no catalogue, awarding nothing, because a prerequisite's mastery must not
// lock access to its material.
//
// So this file pins the two properties that keep the restoration honest, each stated as a
// property of the source rather than a snapshot, because the failure mode is a link or a control
// being *added*:
//
//   1. `/study` is not a second way into the curriculum. It is not in nav, not sitemapped, and
//      has no index/search/domain list. Discovery stays in `/domains`.
//   2. Reading is not evidence. No surface records exposure as progress, and whatever moves
//      mastery does it through the answer seam.
//
// What is deliberately still allowed: the `/api/study/answer` seam (Learn's answer endpoint, a
// name, not a destination), the server-side comments that explain the history, and `/study`
// links from the DAG neighbourhood (they are the reference, not a progression step).
