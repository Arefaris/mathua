// The angle facts, the midsegment, and the prism.
//
// These are the school-course workhorses that were still missing: the exterior angle theorem, the
// midsegment's half, the base angles of an isosceles triangle, the opposite angles of a cyclic
// quadrilateral, and the prism volume that a pyramid's third is measured against.
//
// Every answer is an integer by construction, and each ships an authored solution schema because
// geometry is one of the six learner domains.
