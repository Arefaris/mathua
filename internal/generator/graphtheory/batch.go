// The first graph-theory batch: twenty concepts that open the domain with
// isomorphism, basic constructions, connectivity, matching and coloring.
//
// The discrete-math domain already has graphs, paths, trees, Eulerian and
// Hamiltonian graphs, coloring, bipartite matchings, planarity, Cayley and
// degree sequences. This domain starts after those and goes deeper: it treats
// isomorphism and homomorphism as structure-preserving maps, counts distances
// and cuts, proves the matching/cover min-max pair, and develops chromatic and
// list coloring. The second batch will add planarity, spectral graph theory,
// extremal and random graphs, and flows.
//
// Ten concepts are numeric and ten are multiple choice. Every numeric
// generator publishes the graph parameters its answer follows from, so the
// tests recompute the answer from those facts.
