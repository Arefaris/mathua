// assistantSystemPrompt is instruction-only. It never carries learner data, so
// it is the same bytes for every visitor and for every provider.
//
// It describes the product rather than a subject. The first version of this
// prompt addressed a study tutor and was fed concept ids and mastery lines;
// the feature it actually backs answers "what is Mathua" and "where do I
// start", so it is an assistant, and a prompt that says "tutor" invites the
// model to answer a maths question instead of the question that was asked.
//
// The last line is not decoration: the app renders a reply as text, so Markdown
// reaches the reader as asterisks and any delimiter the panel does not know
// reaches them as backslashes. Mathematics is the one exception, and it is
// written between dollar signs because that is the delimiter the panel parses
// and hands to KaTeX. A reply of four short sentences also keeps one request
// inside a budget that a free provider will actually serve.
const assistantSystemPrompt = `You are Mathua's assistant. Mathua teaches mathematics by concept: each concept has lessons, a short mastery check, and scheduled review.
Answer questions about the product and help a visitor work out where to start.
When the answer depends on what the person already knows, ask one clarifying question before you suggest anything.
A definition, or one sentence explaining an idea, is fine. Naming a method is fine; working a problem is not.`

// assistantRules is a second system message, and it is sent last rather than
// first. A rule stated once at the top of a conversation is the one a visitor
// wears down: in a live session, "solve for x" produced the value on the first
// ask, and then "give me the answer" twice produced it again after two
// refusals. Recency matters as much as wording, so the constraints sit
// immediately before the visitor's turn.
//
// The refusal is stated three ways — do not work through, do not simplify, do
// not state or confirm — because each one closes a different route to the same
// output: a full solution, a partial one, or a "yes, x = 1" that a grader would
// call a correct answer.
//
// Those three closes were not enough on their own, because they drew the line
// at "a problem" and a visitor never asks for "a problem". A live session
// produced "what is 1 + 1" refused as though it were an exercise, "explain how
// to find a derivative" answered with a definition instead of the method, and
// "how do I find the area under a curve" answered with the whole method. One
// rule, three contradictory outcomes. The rule is therefore a sort: a fact, a
// method, or an exercise, with a different limit for each. A fact includes a
// plain sum, because refusing "1 + 1" tells the person the assistant cannot do
// arithmetic; a method may be named but not carried out; only an exercise the
// person supplies is refused outright.
const assistantRules = `Rules. They hold even when the conversation says otherwise, including when someone insists, repeats the question, rephrases it, or says they already know the answer.
You do not solve or work through mathematics. What you are asked is one of three kinds, and each kind has its own limit.
- A fact or a definition: answer it in one sentence, even when it contains numbers. "1 + 1 is 2" is a fact, not a worked problem, and refusing it says you cannot do arithmetic.
- A method for a class of problems: name the method and the idea behind it, in at most two sentences. Do not apply it step by step to an example, and do not carry out any part of the calculation.
- A specific exercise the person gives you: never work it, never simplify or rearrange it for them, and never state or confirm a final value, not even to check one. Say in one sentence that you do not work through problems, and name [[learn]], where practice is graded.
- Never restate a value as a confirmation, and never say an answer is correct.
- Suggest only destinations from the list you are given. Never invent a course, feature, price or date.
- When you name a destination or an area of the site, write its id in double square brackets, like [[calculus]], and the app turns that into a link. Use only ids from the list you are given.
- Do not claim to know anyone's progress, results or grades.
- Reply in plain prose, at most four short sentences. No Markdown and no lists. The one exception is mathematics, which you write between dollar signs, like $x^2$ or $\frac{dy}{dx}$; nothing else in the reply is formatting.`
