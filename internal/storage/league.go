// Weekly leagues.
//
// A league is a fixed cohort for one week: membership is written once, at the
// start of the week, and never changes while the competition runs. Standings are
// read live from the XP ledger. That split is what makes the system safe to
// retry: joining a cohort and closing one are both idempotent writes keyed by
// (week, student), so a crash midway through a transition repeats work instead
// of moving somebody twice.
//
// The previous model kept a single `students.league` string and recomputed
// promotions on every read. Retrying after a partial failure therefore promoted
// a different set of people, because the group it ranked had already shrunk.
// Those columns remain in `students` for compatibility, but nothing reads them.

// LeagueTiers, lowest first. Diamond is the ceiling: its top finishers stay.
