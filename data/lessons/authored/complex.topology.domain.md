# Domains in the complex plane

A **domain** is a set that is both open and connected. The two requirements are independent, and a set that fails either one is not a domain, however natural it looks.

## Openness

Openness says the set has no boundary points of its own: every point is surrounded by a small disk that stays inside. The open unit disk is open; the closed disk is not, and the real axis is not open in the complex plane, because a point on the line has no disk that stays on it.

Openness is about the interior, not about shape, so a set with a hole can still be open as long as the hole's boundary is excluded.

## Connectedness

Connectedness says the set cannot be split into two disjoint, non-empty open pieces. Two disjoint open disks are open but not connected, so they are not a domain even though each piece is.

The punctured plane \(\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}\) is connected despite the missing point: two points can be joined by a path that goes around the origin. Connectedness is about whether paths can travel inside the set, not about whether the set has holes.

## Both at once

A domain needs the two properties together: an open set in which any two points can be joined by a path that stays inside. The punctured plane, an open disk, the upper half-plane and an annulus \(\{z : 1 < |z| < 2\}\) all qualify.

The closed disk fails openness, and the union of two disjoint open disks fails connectedness, the two failure modes are different, and an explanation that separates them is the one that teaches the definition.
