# Planar graphs and Euler's formula

A graph is **planar** when it can be drawn in the plane with no edges crossing. For a connected planar graph, the number of vertices, edges and faces satisfies **Euler's formula** \(V - E + F = 2\), where the outer region counts as one face.

## Euler's formula

The formula is proved by building the graph one edge at a time. A tree has \(F = 1\), and \(V - E = 1\) for a tree, so the formula holds; adding an edge that closes a cycle adds exactly one face and changes \(V - E\) by minus one, and the two changes cancel.

Reading it as a formula for faces is the usual use: \(F = E - V + 2\). A connected planar graph with eight vertices and twelve edges has \(12 - 8 + 2 = 6\) faces, counting the outer one.

## The edge bound

A simple planar graph with \(V \ge 3\) has at most \(3V - 6\) edges. The reason is counting: every face is bounded by at least three edges, and every edge borders two faces, so \(2E \ge 3F\); substituting Euler's formula gives the bound.

The bound is sharp: the tetrahedron has \(V = 4\) and \(6 = 3 \cdot 4 - 6\) edges. Being over the bound rules planarity out immediately, which is the quickest disproof for a dense graph.

## When planarity fails

\(K_5\) has five vertices and ten edges, but \(3 \cdot 5 - 6 = 9\), so it is not planar. \(K_{3,3}\) has six vertices and nine edges, which is under the bound, so the edge count does not settle it, it fails instead because every face would need at least four edges, giving \(2E \ge 4F\) and hence \(E \le 2V - 4 = 8 < 9\).

**Kuratowski's theorem** completes the picture: a graph is planar exactly when it contains no subdivision of \(K_5\) or \(K_{3,3}\). The two forbidden graphs are the whole obstruction, and the edge bounds are the cheap tests that catch most cases first.
