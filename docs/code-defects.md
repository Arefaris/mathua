# Code defects found by a documentation audit

These are code defects, not documentation defects. A documentation sweep found both because
the prose and the code disagreed, and in each case the prose was closer to correct than a
reader would expect.

They are recorded separately from the documentation work on purpose. A fix here changes
product behavior, so it needs its own review and its own test.

## 1. The daily XP goal fallback is a literal, and the package above it exists to prevent that

**Location:** `internal/scoring/updater.go:73`

```go
dailyGoal := 10
if st, err := u.repo.GetStudent(studentID); err == nil && st != nil && st.DailyXPGoal > 0 {
    dailyGoal = st.DailyXPGoal
}
```

`xp.DefaultDailyGoal` is 30 (`internal/xp/policy.go:61`). This fallback applies to any learner
whose stored `DailyXPGoal` is absent, zero, or on a row `GetStudent` does not return. Such a
learner is then measured against 10 XP/day.

The package comment at `internal/xp/policy.go:53-56` records this exact failure:

> Daily XP goal policy. Owned here because the server, the estimator and the client all need the
> same numbers, and they had drifted: the shipped default was 10 while the planner's fallbacks
> said 30, so a learner with no stored goal planned against 3x the XP/day they were actually
> banking.

The same field on the struct just above (`updater.go:31-34`) carries the matching history for
`QuizGateXP`. The invariant was enforced everywhere except the one line that needed it most.

**Suggested fix.** Replace the literal with `xp.DefaultDailyGoal`. Add a test that calls the
updater for a student with no stored goal and asserts the fallback equals `xp.DefaultDailyGoal`,
so the two cannot drift apart again.

**Impact.** Wrong progress bars and wrong daily-goal completion percentages for learners with
no stored goal. No data loss, and no effect on XP actually awarded.

## 2. `-repair-grading` reconstructs progress with a fallback threshold

**Location:** `internal/repair/repair.go:144-155`

```go
reqStreak := 3
thresh := 10.0
if c := dag.Concept(conceptID); c != nil {
    reqStreak = c.MasteryThreshold.Streak
    thresh = c.MasteryThreshold.AvgTimeSeconds
}
if reqStreak <= 0 {
    reqStreak = 3
}
if thresh <= 0 {
    thresh = 10.0
}
```

**This is narrower than it first appears, and the correction matters.** The DAG is consulted
first, so a concept in the graph uses its own real `required_streak` and `time_threshold`. The
literals apply in two cases only: the concept is absent from the DAG, or its stored threshold
is zero or negative.

The residual concern is therefore real but small. For those two cases the replay uses
`required_streak = 3` where the live engine would have used a different value, so the rebuilt
`concept_progress` row can differ from the row the live path would have produced. `replay` is
documented as best-effort in its doc comment in `internal/repair/repair.go`, which states that it
does not reproduce halt/rush XP or per-topic learning-speed evolution exactly. The threshold
fallback was a further deviation the comment did not name.

**Resolved 2026-10-23.** The `replay` doc comment now names the fallback alongside the two
deviations it already carried, and `TestRepair_ReplayFallbackWhenConceptAbsentOrZeroThreshold`
pins what happens for a concept that is absent from the DAG or whose stored
`AvgTimeSeconds` is zero. The same pass removed a larger divergence:
`repair.go` scored the attempt after applying the streak, while the live engine
(`internal/engine/engine.go`, `applyGradedAttempt`) resets the streak on an advance and
grades the attempt after that reset, and the replayed review clock is now set from the
attempt that met the threshold rather than from any attempt that was correct.

**Impact.** Low. Affects only repair runs over concepts with a missing or zero threshold.

## 3. `complex.adv.polar` answers are rounded to whole degrees

**Location:** `internal/generator/complex/generators.go`, the `polarGen` generator.

**What it does.** For a rectangular number built from a Pythagorean triple, the generator computes
`arctan(b/a)` in degrees and rounds it to an integer before writing the polar answer:
`5(cos 53° + i sin 53°)`. For the `(3, 4)` triple the exact argument is about 53.13°, so the
answer states an approximate value as though it were exact.

**Why it has not broken.** The `complex` grader converts the polar form with a regex that accepts
integers only and then compares both sides in SymPy. Because expected and answer are both the rounded
string, the comparison agrees with itself. A learner who types the accurate angle, `53.13°`, either
fails the regex or is compared against the rounded value and is marked wrong.

**Why it was not fixed here.** The fix would change the answer format of an existing concept, a
generator and its grader and that is outside the `complex_numbers` batch that found it. Choosing
between exact integer arguments (only multiples of 30° and 45° have exact sines and cosines), a
`±`-style tolerance in the answer, or dropping polar answers in favour of exponential form is a
decision about the concept, not a repair.

**Suggested fix.** Restrict `polarGen` to angles whose sine and cosine are exact, 30°, 45°, 60°,
90°, 120°, 135°, 150°, 180° and the reflex ones and pick radii so the rectangular form stays
integral. `TestComplexAcceptsEquivalentForms` already covers the polar path with a whole-degree case,
so a change there would be caught by the grader test.

**Impact.** Low for grading (the generator and the grader agree), real for a learner: the concept
teaches that a polar form is exact when the number it came from is a triple, and a learner who works
out the true angle is marked wrong for being right.

## What this document is not

Neither defect is a documentation error, and neither is fixed by the documentation sweep. They
are listed here so that the sweep's findings are not read as a claim that the prose is the only
thing that can be wrong.
